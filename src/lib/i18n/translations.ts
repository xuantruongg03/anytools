                        a2: "No relay candidates usually means: (1) TURN server URL is incorrect, (2) TURN credentials are wrong, (3) TURN server is not running, or (4) Firewall is blocking TURN traffic. Check your server configuration and credentials.",

                        a3: "For production WebRTC applications, you should configure both. STUN is used for most connections (cheaper, faster), but TURN is essential as a fallback for users behind restrictive firewalls or symmetric NATs (approximately 8-10% of connections).",

                        a1: "STUN giúp phát hiện địa chỉ IP công khai và cổng của bạn để kết nối peer-to-peer trực tiếp. TURN là relay server được sử dụng khi kết nối trực tiếp thất bại do NAT/firewall nghiêm ngặt. TURN tốn kém hơn vì nó chuyển tiếp tất cả lưu lượng.",
                        q2: "Tại sao tôi không nhận được relay candidate?",
                        a2: "Không có relay candidate thường có nghĩa là: (1) URL TURN server không chính xác, (2) Thông tin xác thực TURN sai, (3) TURN server không chạy, hoặc (4) Tường lửa chặn lưu lượng TURN. Kiểm tra cấu hình server và thông tin xác thực của bạn.",
                        q3: "Tôi có cần cả STUN và TURN server không?",
                        a3: "Đối với ứng dụng WebRTC production, bạn nên cấu hình cả hai. STUN được sử dụng cho hầu hết kết nối (rẻ hơn, nhanh hơn), nhưng TURN rất cần thiết như một dự phòng cho người dùng đằng sau tường lửa hạn chế hoặc symmetric NAT (khoảng 8-10% kết nối).",
                        q4: "Kiểm tra sẽ mất bao lâu?",
                        a4: "Thu thập ICE thường hoàn thành trong 2-10 giây. Nếu mất hơn 30 giây, có thể có vấn đề mạng hoặc server. Công cụ có thời gian chờ 30 giây để đảm bảo an toàn.",
                        q5: "STUN server công khai nào tốt để kiểm tra?",
                        a5: "Google cung cấp STUN server miễn phí: stun:stun.l.google.com:19302, stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302, v.v. Đối với TURN server, bạn cần thiết lập riêng (sử dụng coturn) hoặc sử dụng dịch vụ trả phí như Twilio, Xirsys hoặc Metered.",
